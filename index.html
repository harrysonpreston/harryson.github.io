        <p>Welcome to my story and guide for building a profitable micro saas business. This site will describe the trials and tribulations I am facing in real time as I attempt to build a niche, yet profitable business. And try again.</p>
        <p>In this overview, I will focus first and foremost on what I did wrong! I strongly believe the most powerful form of learning is through failure, however I am sharing my missteps and learnings here to condense and accelerate your own cycles. Along the way, I will share with you my own take on building a web-based business coming from a non-technical background.</p>
        <p>There are a few great resources on the web about the Micro SaaS business model. I will reference these guides frequently and augment them with my own personal experience trying to follow the step-by-step process to building a niche business including what did and did not work.</p>

        <p>Two reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>There is something that feels good about creation and sharing ðŸ¤·</li>
          <li>As mentioned, I have a non-technical background. This series is a helpful way for me to practice my nascent web development skills. Sharpening these skills help me iterate on new business ideas faster and more independently. If you are like me, <strong>I highly recommend picking up some dev skills</strong>, it will save you money in the long run and make you more efficient at communicating with developers if you choose to hire them anyway. I'll share some tips as we go through this guide on how I learned.</li>

        <h2 class="semi-bold">What is SaaS</h2>
        <p>Letâ€™s first make sure we have a common understanding of SaaS. Software as a Service (SaaS) companies offer services over the internet which donâ€™t require a download (cloud based software).</p>
        <p>They usually charge a monthly or annual subscription fee for access to their platform or service. Jeff Bezosâ€™ democratization of computing resources with AWS made the expansion of this business model infinitely more accessible to the average entrepreneur like you and me. Some major SaaS players include:

        <p><a href="https://golden.com/query/list-of-software-as-a-service-companies-BMY" target="_blank" title="A complete list of SaaS companies">The list</a> is endless! In fact it's hard to find a large tech company these days that doesn't have a SaaS revenue stream, it's that attractive to investors ðŸ’°. One more distinction we should make is between B2B SaaS and B2C SaaS.</p>
        <p>As you know, B2B (business to business) SaaS means your customers are other business, whereas B2C (business to consumer) SaaS means you are selling to an end user. A few B2B examples from above include Workday, Shopify, Datadog while B2C examples include Spotify and Netflix.</p>
        
        <h2 class="semi-bold">What is 'Micro' SaaS?</h2>
        <p>Micro-saas is quite simply a smaller, more niche version of a SaaS business. Usually a solo endeavor run by one person or a very small team. The goal is to find the smallest business problem that you can solve better, cheaper, or prettier (sleeker user interface) than the competition.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps there is no competition because the problem is too small, with not enough ROI (return on investment) for bigger companies to tackle. There are many different types of Micro Saas companies which we'll cover in the next section.
        
        <h2 class="semi-bold">Types of Micro SaaS Businesses</h2>
